Problem Statement

Waste segregation is one of the key challenges in achieving environmental sustainability. Every day, tons of mixed waste are generated, and improper segregation at the source leads to increased landfill use and pollution.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered image classification system that can automatically identify the type of waste item from an image and classify it into one of six categories:
Cardboard, Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, and Trash.

By automating waste classification using machine learning, we can assist:

Municipal corporations in improving recycling rates,

Recycling plants in sorting waste more efficiently, and

Citizens in understanding how to dispose of waste properly.

This contributes directly to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 — Responsible Consumption and Production, by promoting recycling and responsible waste management.
